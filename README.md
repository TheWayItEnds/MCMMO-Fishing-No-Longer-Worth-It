MCMMO-Fishing-No-Longer-Worth-It
================================

The fishing MCMMO skill the way it's at is really not worth it to be added in the game itself. Honestly, we're having more and more people go AFK due to the patience and time they have to wait to get 1 fish now. This fish bite percent needs to be increased or make more and more of the rare rewards increased. It's impossible to get to level 500 legit now. It's insanely crazy how you can stay stuck under level 100 for those new people.
